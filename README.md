# Unlocking Artistic Potential - A Fresh Approach to Assessing Neural Style Transfer Results

This is the Code for our project report which deals with developing a metric for Neural Style Transfer.
Our Code computes stylized images and computes Metric for all of those created Images based on our Metric.
The corresponding Images can be found under ./StylizedImages/VGG or ./StylizedImages/Mobile or ./StylizedImages/Mobile
for the respective Architecture.

## DataSet

We are doing the computation for style and content Images. The style Images can be found under StylesForTraining and the Content Images under ImagesForTraining.

### Requirements

Our requirements can be found under ./Requirements.txt as well as jupyter Notebook.

#### How to Run the code

In order to run the Code, you need to go with the Terminal into this folder and type:
jupyter notebook
